CS 2005 Nov. 8 – First Iteration
	
	For the first iteration of the project we decided to implement the Create Profile use case.
This use case involves the user opening the “Create Profile” screen and entering a username and password. 
The app then stores this information, and then whenever the user accesses their account the app will verify their 
information is correct, and load the data associated with the account. 
	
	For our implementation of Create Profile, the biggest challenge was how to store the user’s profile data. 
We decided to store a user as an object in a text file. When a user creates an account, the methods in the GUI take 
the username and password and instantiate a current user with the entered information. This information is then stored 
in a text file, and the GUI sets the current user to this user and takes them to the home screen where they can view 
their data. Subsequently when the user attempts to log in, the GUI will scan the text file to find a matching name and 
password. If no match is found, the user will be shown an error message; otherwise, the GUI sets the current user as this
 user.
