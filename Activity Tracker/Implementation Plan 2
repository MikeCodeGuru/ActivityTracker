CS 2005 Nov. 15 - Second Iteration
For the second iteration we decided to implement the use case View Data, in order to be able to
read in and store a user's data and display it in a graph. We will be implementing statistics using the data
in the next iteration, for now we are only interested in enabling a user to easily look through their data.
Assuming the user has already logged in, the use case View Data involves a user selecting the Statistics
option under their profile, choosing an activity, and then selecting a date to bring up a particular session.
The application will then display the duration of the session, the distance covered (if, for example,
running was the activity selected), and the altitude.
For our implementation of View Data, some of the challenges we faced were how to read in
data from a text file and store it in a way our application could use. The data was given to us in 30
second increments, so we decided to break up the time data, distance data, and altitude data into
separate lists, where each index of the list would represent a 30 second mark. Another challenge was
how to actually display the data once it was stored, and for this we decided to use the JTable class. Once
the data is read in, JTable will display each index of each list as a point on the graph.
