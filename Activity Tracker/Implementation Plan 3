CS 2005 Nov 22 - Third Iteration
For the third iteration we're implementing a new use case that builds upon View Data, viewing Record data. We will be implementing more statistics (average
speed, average time, etc.) using the data in each Session, and displaying this to the user in a way that they can pick and choose which statistics across which dates they wish to implement.
Assuming the user has already logged in, the use case View Record Data involves a user selecting the Statistics option under their profile, then
selecting the view records button. Then the application will display the average duration of the session, the average distance covered, etc.
For our implementation of View Record Data. Some of the challenges we will face are determining the equations and altering our data in such a way that it will display the records
the users wish, as well as reading our data from the text file in a way that we can organize that data in viewable form by date and other stats.
